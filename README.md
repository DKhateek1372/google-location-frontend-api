To run this code you need to put YOUR CODE into your system local server like XMAPP and start the local server.
( I use XMAPP ).
use this command ----> sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start 

I use bower so you need to first install BOWER into the code .
Use this Command --->       $ npm install -g bower.

After installing bower you need to install all libraries. so use 
`bower install` command

we are using this  COMMAND because to install all the angular libraries we used in our project.
